Find your YouTube subscribers on other platforms. Simply search a keyword(e.g. twitter, github), and get back channels that include the keyword in their about me links.



### Tech Stack
- **YouTube API**: The API is needed to get your subscription. The YouTube API dosen't provide the external links the channel has setup, so a thrid part API is being to used to extract the links. (Your data is not given to any third parties, only the channelID of your subscribers is given, which is public data). The third party API in use: [YouTube-operational-API](https://github.com/Benjamin-Loison/YouTube-operational-API)
